## Biography
Second-year undergraduate at Brown University concentrating in Computer Science - Economics. Interested in Cyber Warfare and
the intersection of machine and deep learning with cybersecurity in private-sector and military applications. Experienced in
management, project planning and execution, leadership, and computer programming. On-track to commission as a 2nd Lieutenant
in the United States Air Force in 2027.

## Work Experience
**Air Force ROTC Cadet @ Detachment 340 (_September 2023 - Present_)**
- Served as the Oscar Flight Deputy Commander for the Fall 2024 Semester
- Led training through live exercises such as wargaming and marching
- Created briefings and briefed cadets and detachment cadre
- Communicated responses/action plans resulting from feedback
- Facilitated wing and squadron level program planning and execution
- Led and mentored small groups under simulated high-intensity scenarios

**Professional Development Team, Detachment 340, i5space, US Space Force STARCOM (October 2024 - Present_)**
- Co-founder
- Planned and executed cybersecurity training through CTF (Capture the Flag) exercises
- Taught concepts such as web exploitation, reverse engineering, enumeration, and python scripting

## Projects
### Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning (CIC-IDS 2017 Dataset)
Developed a machine learning model to detect network intrusions with high accuracy. This project involved analyzing network traffic data, training a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluating its performance.
**Key Achievements:**
- Achieved 99.7% accuracy in identifying malicious activity.
- Successfully trained a Random Forest Classifier to distinguish between benign and malicious network 
 traffic.
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data analysis, model building, 
 and visualization.
- Leveraged Google Colab for development and execution

### Java Implementation of Connect 4 with Minimax Algorithm
Utilized a hybrid heuristic that analyzed the spatial relationship between player pieces and a weight map of opportune coordinates

### Python Implementation of a 1979 Messaging Board System with Resource Constraints
Constructed with the constraint of being unable to use existing data structures and having to minimize file read/write calls.

### Multimodal Graph Implementation in Java
Constructed from scratch an implementation of a graph data structure using both nodes and arrays for the underlying data structures. Abstracted methods and utilized interfaces to build modularity into the usage of either underlying data structure. Implemented a Breadth First Search Algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in either Graph structure. Implemented an algorithm that represented scheduling conflicts as a graph, then allocated meeting times to members efficiently and verified that no conflicts were created in the allocation.
